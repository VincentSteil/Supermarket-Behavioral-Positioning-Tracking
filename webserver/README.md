Supermarket Web Server
======================

This is the web server that bridges the gap between the Android phone clients
and the information in the database. It maintains a consistent connection with
all the nodes - updating the database when a customer appears and continuously
updating the customer on deals based on their x and y values.



Installing Dependencies
-----------------------
`cd webserver`
`npm install`
